"""Multi-tool MCP server exposing the agentic NL2SQL pipeline to MCP clients.

WHAT MCP IS, IN ONE PARAGRAPH
-----------------------------
The Model Context Protocol is a wire protocol that lets an LLM host (Claude
Desktop, Claude Code, an IDE, a custom agent) discover and call tools that live
in a separate process. The host speaks JSON-RPC to this process over stdio (or
HTTP/SSE). Every function decorated with `@mcp.tool()` below is advertised to
the host during the `tools/list` handshake -- name, description, and a JSON
Schema for its arguments -- and the host's model decides when to call it. The
docstrings in this file are not documentation for humans alone: FastMCP lifts
them verbatim into the tool description the model reads when deciding whether a
tool is relevant. Vague docstrings produce a model that calls the wrong tool.

THE TOOL SURFACE
----------------
    nl2sql_list_databases     which databases exist           (discovery)
    nl2sql_get_capabilities   what every tool enforces/refuses (discovery)
    nl2sql_generate_sql       question  -> corrected SQL       (LLM, 5 agents)
    nl2sql_validate_sql       SQL       -> read-only verdict   (no LLM)
    nl2sql_execute_query      SQL       -> rows                (no LLM)
    nl2sql_explain_result     rows      -> plain-language text (LLM)
    nl2sql_query_database     question  -> SQL + rows          (all-in-one)

Granular tools let a calling agent make a decision between steps: inspect the
generated SQL, edit it, refuse to run it, or run its own SQL entirely. The
all-in-one tool predates the split and is kept so existing client configs keep
working.

READ-ONLY IS ENFORCED AT THE TOOL BOUNDARY
------------------------------------------
validate and execute accept SQL from ANY caller, so they run the three-layer
gate in src/db/sql_guard.py on every call: a compile-time SQLite authorizer
that permits only reads, then PRAGMA query_only, then a mode=ro connection.
execute re-runs the gate itself rather than trusting that validate was called
first -- "validated SQL" is a claim by the caller, not a fact.

WHY THIS IS A PROXY AND NOT AN IN-PROCESS AGENT
-----------------------------------------------
This module does NOT import `src.graph` or call `build_graph()`. It forwards
HTTP requests to the FastAPI service in `api/main.py` instead. Two reasons:

1. Memory. `build_graph()` pulls in Chroma plus the ONNX embedder used for
   schema retrieval. `k8s/03-api.yaml` sizes the API container at a 1Gi limit
   precisely because 512Mi got OOM-killed (exit 137) on the first real query
   with exactly ONE copy of that stack resident. Building the graph here too
   would mean a second full copy to compute answers the API already computes.

2. Drift. An in-process copy is a second code path. As a proxy, there is
   exactly one implementation of each step, and MCP callers get the same
   answers as the REST API by construction. That includes the safety gate:
   it lives in the API, so calling the API directly bypasses nothing.

Splitting into seven tools did not change this: each tool maps to one API
endpoint, and the graph is still built exactly once, in the API process.

    use nl2sql_query_database instead.

    HOW THE SQL IS PRODUCED
    -----------------------
    The full five-agent pipeline runs: schema retrieval (vector search for the
    relevant tables), query planning, SQL generation, trial execution, and --
    on failure -- an error classifier that routes back to whichever agent
    caused it, up to the server's retry budget.

    The trial execution is the reason this is not "just the generator". Self-
    correction is driven by what went wrong when the SQL ran, so the pipeline
    has to run it to correct it. The SQL returned is the corrected output, and
    it is what the project's 44.20% BIRD-SQL benchmark figure describes. Those
    internal runs are read-only (PRAGMA query_only plus a mode=ro connection).

    WHAT THE FIELDS MEAN
    --------------------
    - `sql`: the final statement, or null if none was produced.
    - `pipeline_trial_succeeded`: the SQL ran without error inside the
      pipeline. It does NOT mean the SQL answers the question correctly --
