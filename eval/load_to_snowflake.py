"""
Load one benchmark run's results CSV into Snowflake.

Standalone on purpose. This is the script Airflow will invoke unattended, so
it has to be a complete unit of work on its own: parse arguments, resolve
configuration, open its own connection, load, exit with a meaningful status.
Bolting it onto run_benchmark.py would tie loading to running, and the two
have genuinely different lifecycles -- a run happens once and takes hours, a
load can be re-run, backfilled, or pointed at a CSV produced months earlier.

Usage:
    python eval/load_to_snowflake.py --csv eval/results.csv --config-label baseline

Configuration resolution, in precedence order:
  1. An explicit --flag on the command line always wins.
  2. Otherwise the field is read from --metadata (default
     eval/run_metadata.json), the sidecar run_benchmark.py now writes.
  3. Otherwise model fields become "unknown (pre-tracking)".

There is deliberately NO fallback for run_timestamp. If no metadata file
exists and --run-timestamp was not passed, this exits with an error rather
than using the current time. Defaulting there would stamp a months-old
benchmark as having run today -- silently corrupting the one column the table
exists to keep honest, in a way nobody would ever catch by reading the data.

Note on run_timestamp storage: EVAL_RUNS.run_timestamp is TIMESTAMP_NTZ,
which has no timezone. Offset-aware inputs are therefore converted to UTC
before insert, so runs recorded in different offsets stay comparable. The
original offset label is not preserved; a TIMESTAMP_TZ column would be needed
for that.
