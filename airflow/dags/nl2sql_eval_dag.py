"""
Weekly NL2SQL regression pipeline: benchmark -> load -> drift check.

WEEKLY, NOT DAILY. Every run makes real LLM API calls for all 150 questions
(planner + generator + a classifier call per retry), so the schedule is a cost
decision, not a freshness one. catchup=False for the same reason: on first
unpause Airflow would otherwise backfill one run per missed interval since
start_date, each one a full paid benchmark.

The three tasks are strictly sequential because each consumes the previous
one's output: the loader needs the CSV, and the drift check needs the run row
the loader created in Snowflake.

        The timestamped output path matters for two reasons. The obvious one is
        that each run keeps its own artifact. The load-bearing one is that
        run_benchmark.py RESUMES from whatever its results file already
        contains: pointed at a previous run's file it would skip all 150
        questions, do nothing, and emit byte-identical output that the loader
        would then reject as a duplicate hash. A fresh path per run makes that
        impossible.

        Invoked as `python -m eval.run_benchmark`, not by file path, because
        the module does `from eval.metrics import ...` -- running it by path
        puts eval/ on sys.path instead of the project root and that import
        fails.
