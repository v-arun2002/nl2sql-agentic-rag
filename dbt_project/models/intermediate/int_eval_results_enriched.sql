-- Per-question results with their run's configuration attached, so downstream
-- marts can slice accuracy by model/provider without re-joining every time.
--
-- INNER join is deliberate. Every result row should have a parent run --
-- eval/load_to_snowflake.py inserts EVAL_RUNS before loading EVAL_RESULTS, and
-- the FK is declared in the DDL. But Snowflake does not ENFORCE foreign keys,
-- so an orphan is possible in principle. An inner join drops orphans silently,
-- which is why the `relationships` test in models/staging/schema.yml exists:
-- it fails the build if any result's run_id is missing from stg_eval_runs,
-- turning a silent row-count discrepancy into a loud error.
